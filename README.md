# Rust: Nature of Code
Implementing the nature of code examples using rust.

I am mostly using this as a tool to learn Rust and Piston so the implemtations will likely be sub optimal and there will be a lot of repeated code. I also likely won't be updating old exersizes as I learn better ways to do things.
